// # Exercise 1: The Passing Grade (if / else)

// # Scenario: A teacher needs to automatically determine if a student has passed or failed a quiz based on their score.
// - Task: Write a script that checks a variable called score.
// - Rules:
// - If the score is 50 or higher, print "Pass".
// - If the score is less than 50, print "Fail".
// - Bonus Challenge: Add an extra condition. If the score is exactly 100, print "Perfect Score!" instead of just "Pass".
// const score = 100;

// if (score === 100) {
//     console.log("Perfect Score!");
// } else if (score >= 50) {
//     console.log("Pass");
// } else {
//     console.log("Fail");
// }

// # Exercise 2: Counting Even Numbers (for loop + if)

// # Scenario: You need to list out numbers, but you only want to highlight the even ones.
// - Task: Write a for loop that counts from 1 up to 10 (inclusive).
// - Rules:
//   - Inside the loop, use an if statement and the remainder operator (%) to check if the current number is even.
//   - Print only the even numbers to the console (2, 4, 6, 8, 10).

for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    console.log(i);
  }
}

// # Exercise 3: Blast Off Countdown (while loop)

// # Scenario: Simulate a rocket launch countdown.
// - Task: Create a variable called counter and set it to 5.
// - Rules:
// 	- Use a while loop that runs as long as counter is greater than 0.
// 	- Inside the loop, print the current value of counter and then decrease it by 1.
// 	- After the loop finishes entirely, print "Blast off! 🚀".

let counter = 5;

while (counter > 0) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter--;
}

console.log("Blast off! 🚀");
